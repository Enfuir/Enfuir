## 🎯 About Me

Just a beginner exploring the fascinating world of **low-level systems programming** and **computer architecture**. I'm learning by doing small projects and documenting my journey.

```c
// Still learning the basics
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    // One step at a time...
    return 0;
}
```

### 🌱 Currently Learning

- **Systems Programming** - Understanding how computers work at a low level
- **C/C++** - Building a foundation in systems languages
- **Assembly** - Learning x86/x64 basics (very slowly!)
- **UEFI/BIOS** - Exploring firmware and boot processes
- **Hardware** - Tinkering with PCIe devices and memory

### 📚 Learning Resources I Use

- Online tutorials and documentation
- Open source projects (reading code to learn)
- Technical books and papers
- Community forums and Discord servers

## 📂 My Projects

These are just **learning projects** and experiments. Nothing fancy, just me trying to understand how things work:

### 🔹 IOMMU Research Notes
> Personal notes and experiments while learning about AMD IOMMU architecture
> - Reading ACPI tables
> - Understanding IVRS structures
> - Educational purposes only

### 🔹 Small System Tools
> Basic utilities I'm building to learn systems programming
> - Simple memory readers
> - Hardware enumeration tools
> - Learning by doing!

## 💭 My Philosophy

> _"The best way to learn is by building things, even if they're simple."_

I'm not an expert - just someone curious about how computers work at a fundamental level. Every project is a learning experience, and I'm documenting my journey in case it helps other beginners.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

All my projects are **educational experiments** for learning purposes. I'm just a hobbyist trying to understand how systems work. Please use any code responsibly and only on systems you own.
